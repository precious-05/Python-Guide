    "- \"Duration\" and \"Calories\" got a 0.922721 correlation, which is a very good correlation, and we can predict that the longer you work out, the more calories you burn, and the other way around: if you burned a lot of calories, you probably had a long work out.\n",

    "#### Bad Correlation:\n",
    "- \"Duration\" and \"Maxpulse\" got a 0.009403 correlation, which is a very bad correlation, meaning that we can not predict the max pulse by just looking at the duration of the work out, and vice versa."
