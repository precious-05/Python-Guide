#AS we can see that we have imported the Aliace1 python file we can say it is a python module
#Now in the Aliace2 we wanted to call its methos so we had to import this python module
#But maybe the python module name was so big such as Aliace1inPython then using this to call methoos would be difficult
#To create the nickname or alice in Python we have to use the keyword "as"
#Giving a nickname or aliace to a python module is called aliacing
