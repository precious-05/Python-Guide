    "\n",
    "2. Integration: When integrating different applications or services that need to share data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Integration of a Weather API with a Mobile App\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "You have a mobile app that provides weather forecasts. To get the weather data, your app needs to fetch information from a weather service API. The weather service API provides the data in JSON format.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How It Works:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Mobile App Requests Data:\n",
    "\n",
