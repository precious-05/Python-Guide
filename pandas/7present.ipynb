    "\n",
    "- Why we need to use pandas if we can analyze data through excel?\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we ananlyze our data in excel (Analyzing data in Excel means examining and interpreting data using tools and functions to find patterns, trends, and insights)\n",
    "\n",
    "-  2 Example: Analyzing a company's data on losses and profits over time helps identify trends, such as whether profits are increasing or losses are decreasing. This analysis can guide decisions on how to improve financial performance\n",
    "\n",
    "- 3 Example: Analyzing data on the number of students enrolled in a course over time helps identify trends, such as whether enrollment is increasing     decreasing. This analysis can guide decisions on how to improve course offerings\n",
    "\n",
    "- 4 Example: Analyzing data on the number of customers who have purchased a product over time helps identify trends, such as whether sales are increasing or decreasing. \n",
    "- This analysis can guide decisions on how to improve marketing strategies\n",

    "**What is problem with excel then ? If we can analyze data in excel too?**\n",
    "  1. *The main problem with excel is that While Excel is powerful for many tasks, its programmatic capabilities are limited compared to Python*\n",
    "  *VBA is available, but it's generally considered more complex and less versatile than Python and pandas for data manipulation*\n",
    "  *Visual Basic for Applications. It's a programming language developed by Microsoft that is used for automation and scripting within Microsoft Office applications, such as Excel, Word, and Access.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  2. *Another problem is that Excel is not designed for large-scale data analysis. \n",
    "     *It can become slow and unresponsive when dealing with large datasets*\n",
    "     *We can't do much with excel when we have large data sets*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefits of Using Pandas**\n",
    "1. *Pandas is a powerful and flexible library for data manipulation and analysis in Python*\n",
    "\n",
    "2. *We can read columns and bring them to data frames. Such as if we have following data in rows and columns of excel sheet.\n",
    "    1. Name---------------Subject----------T.Marks-----Obt.Marks\n",
    "    2. Alice--------------English------------100 ------------80\n",
    "    3. Merry--------------English------------100-------------88\n",
    "    4. Katherine----------English------------100-------------88\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pandas read this data and put it in RAM and after that we perform analysis. ( & we know that Accessing data from RAM is faster than accessing from disc.)Thats why the computation speeds-up.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pandas is designed for large-scale data analysis and can handle massive datasets with ease*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pandas provides data structures and functions to efficiently handle structured data, including tabular data such as  spreadsheets and SQL tables, and time series data*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pandas is highly extensible and can be used in conjunction with other popular data science libraries in  Python, such as NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn*\n",
    "\n",
    "*Pandas is highly scalable and can handle large datasets with ease*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**\"scalable\" means that pandas can handle large datasets more efficiently than Excel. Pandas is designed to manage and process large volumes of data effectively. It provides better performance and more memory management features, which makes it suitable for handling big data and complex analyses that might be cumbersome in Excel. However, for extremely large datasets, even pandas might need additional tools or approaches, such as using Dask or integrating with databases.**"

This allows for more flexible and meaningful data access compared to arrays with fixed integer indices as in Numpy arrays*"
